fix>>>> 
1. Added keyword static to make it private static final logger LOGGER in MobileNumberUtils
2. Changed PreInsert to PrePersit as PreInsert could not be resolved.
3. Commented out this(super) as both are keywords. Super is used to access the super class' methods, it should not be used as a variabale or parameter.
4. Replaced the unresolved persist() and update() to save().
5. Added keyword this to make it this.code = code to resolve returning a null String for the 'code' in ResponseCode.java
6. Inserted constructor based dependency Injection to instantiate the ReportingProcessor bean for the EpayResource class. however autowired could have worked
